# MaxHeap-and-BST-Tree
This is my university project In this program, I wrote the Max Heap tree and the BST tree code , which has several functions
 1:Insert Heap/                       2:Is Heap/ 
 3:Find & Delete from Heap/           4:Print Sorted Heap/ 
 5:Merge Heaps/                       6:Print kth Biggest Num In Heap/ 
 7:Heap to BST/                       8:Insert BST/    
 9:Is BST/                           10:Find & Delete from BST/     
11:Print Sorted BST/                 12:Merge BST/
